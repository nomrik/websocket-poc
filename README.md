This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Example chat style project (server & client) for use of WebSockets with Redux Saga.

To run on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository
2. `yarn install`
3. `cd server` and `node server.js` to run the server. The default port for the server is `8090`.
4. In a separate terminal window, from the root directory of the repository run `yarn start` to start the react app on `localhost:3000`.
5. You can then go to `https://nomrik.github.io/websocket-poc` and chat away with the two clients.
